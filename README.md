## Introduction

Arcemu is a World of Warcraft server package. Based on the popular Ascent project (defunct as of 2007) it aims to provide players with a gameplay very close or identical to the real thing as of World of Warcraft version 3.3.5a.

It's a multithreaded C++ application with a relational database as a data storage backend(mysql).

It also supports the popular Lua scripting language for easy extension, and customization.

NOTE: This project is mostly abandoned since the end of 2014. However feel free to try and have fun with it.
